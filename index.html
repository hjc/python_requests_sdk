					<h2>What We'll Cover</h2>
					<p>
						<ol>
							<li>What is an SDK and an API anyway?</li>
							<li>How should I interact with an API?</li>
							<li>How do I build my own SDK?</li>
						</ol>
					</p>

				<section>
					<h2>Some Quick Definitions</h2>
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								API - Application Programming Interface
							</li>
							<li>
								SDK - Software Development Kit
							</li>
							<li>
								REST - Representational State Transfer
							</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						API - a set of routines or protocols used to build or interact with a piece of software.
						<br>
						SDK - a set of tools that aid in the creation of applications for a certain platform, framework, or software package.
						<br>
						REST - an architecture pattern that is popular in the creation of scalable web services. Basically: no state, and a uniform interface for accessing resources.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>SDK Examples</h2>

					<ul>
						<li>
							Google's oauth2client - github.com/google/oauth2client
						</li>
						<li>
							Instagram's Python API SDK - github.com/Instagram/python-instagram
						</li>
						<li>
							Twitter's Python API SDK - github.com/bear/python-twitter
						</li>
						<li>
							Tumblr's Python API SDK - github.com/tumblr/pytumblr
						</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						Google has one for Python.
						<br>
						Instagram has one for Python.
						<br>
						Twitter has one for Python.
						<br>
						TUMBLR has one for Python....
						<br>
						But no Facebook SDK.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Facebook's "Python SDK"</h2>
					<img src="img/facebook_sdks.png" style="max-height: 575px;">

					<aside class="notes">
						So, one begins to look for a FB SDK and this is what they find.
						<br>
						Nada.
						<br>
						Sidenote, I love how they have a qt SDK, and an official Django SDK, but no official Python SDK. 
						<br>
						Small message on how we use Flask, so Django one won't work
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Facebook's "Python SDK"</h2>
					<p>
						Unofficial SDK's:

						<br>
						<br>
						<ul>
							<li>
								pythonforfacebook - github.com/pythonforfacebook/facebook-sdk
							</li>
							<li>
								fb - github.com/blaklites/fb
							</li>
						</ul>

						<aside class="notes">
							So, we stumble upon two unofficial SDK's for Facebook written in Python.
							<br>
							Upon closer examination, both have an identical API and have the same version of
							0.4.0, last updated about 2 years ago.
							<br>
							<br>
							It's likely these are forks of an unsuccessful original FB SDK. The only updates
							that have happened are documentation changes. Finally, they don't have full feature
							support and development is dead.
						</aside>
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Solution?</h2>
					<p>
						We'll roll our own!
					</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						So, we'll just make our own with our own little API!
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Where to begin?</h2>

					<ul>
						<li>
							Read the API Reference.
						</li>
						<li>
							Pick an existing HTTP library to help you do your job.
						</li>
						<li>
							Software library architectural fun times.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						We have a LOT to do here! Mostly in steps 1 and 3.
						<br>
						API references are quite complex and writing a module well is too, so points
						1 and 3 won't be covered (though, hopefully, I'll return to cover point 3 in
						the future). So let's handle number 2 and pick an HTTP library
						<br>
						So, from here, an individual could go one of two ways. 
						<br>
						The first way is to exclusively use built-in Python modules.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Built-in Python HTTP Modules</h2>
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li>httplib</li>
							<li>urllib</li>
							<li>urllib2</li>
							<li>urlparse</li>
							<li>mimetools</li>
							<li>cgi</li>
							<li>email</li>
						</ul>
					</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						So, admittedly, this is a list for Python2.7, and things are better in 3, but 
						still, this is ridiculous. Their usage is non-obvious and they generally have
						to be used together. Heaven forbid you actually have to use httplib for some
						reason.
						<br>
						I've actually used all of these at one point or another to deal with HTTP and
						API interactions on a lower level.
						(I've used email to parse headers).
						<br>
						Also, there's totally a urllib3, and the difference between urllib and urllib2 
						are... annoying (example: urlencode is only in urllib).
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Built-in Python HTTP Modules</h2>
					<section>
						<p>
							What that looks like:
							<pre>
								<code data-trim contenteditable>
import urllib2
import urllib
u = urllib2.urlopen("http://www.google.com?" \
  + urllib.urlencode({"q": "nycpython"}))
raw_content = u.read()
								</code>
							</pre>
						</p>

						<aside class="notes">
							This is just for a simple GET, which isn't rough at all, but
							demonstrates my general point.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>
							A delete:
							<pre>
								<code data-trim contenteditable>
handler = urllib2.HTTPHandler()
opener = urllib2.build_opener(handler)
request = urllib2.Request("https://graph.facebook.com/videos/4")
request.add_header("Content-Type", 'application/json')
request.get_method = lambda: "DELETE"  # because that's obvious
try:
    connection = opener.open(request)
except urllib2.HTTPError,e:
    connection = e  # a non-200 throws an Error
								</code>
							</pre>

							<aside class="notes">
								So yea... that escalated quickly and nothing in there is pretty.
								<br>
								There is an extra step added to handle 302's (urllib2 likes to drop the
								method you're using on redirect), but that's still pretty rough.
								<br>
								It's right about now that you're starting to seriously question your choice.
								And we haven't even talked SSL, or unicode
								So, the other option an individual could take is.... REQUESTS!!!
							</aside>
						</p>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Requests: HTTP for Humans</h2>
					<p>
						<img style="max-height: 550px" src="img/requests_homepage.png">

						<aside class="notes">
							Requests pretty much lives up to its name and is a sane
							HTTP library, designed for easy human consumption.
							<br>
							And look at those testimonials!
						</aside>
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Using Requests</h2>
						<p>
							The same GET request from earlier:

							<pre>
								<code data-trim contenteditable>
import requests
u = requests.get("http://www.google.com", params={"q": "nycpython"})
raw_content = u.content
								</code>
							</pre>

							<aside class="notes">
								It's a little less verbose, but, more importantly, it's
								easier to remember and a LOT more sane.
							</aside>
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>
							Now, a delete:
							<pre>
								<code data-trim contenteditable>
import requests
u = requests.delete("https://graph.facebook.com/videos/4")
json_response = u.json()
								</code>
							</pre>

							<aside class="notes">
								Ummm... yea. The benefits are pretty clear now.
								<br>
								So, we'll carry on with requests.
							</aside>
						</p>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Starting with the Facebook API</h2>
					<p>
						First, you need an app from: 
						<a href="https://developers.facebook.com/">
							https://developers.facebook.com/
						</a>

						<aside class="notes">
							So, now you'll need to create your own FB app and grab
							the app ID and the app secret, we'll use those a lot. Take note of
							the redirect URI you used as well.
							<br>
							Toss them in a secret_keys.py file and we're good to go!
						</aside>
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>The Server-Side OAuth2 Workflow</h2>
					<ol>
						<li>Generate Authorization URL based on scopes.</li>
						<li>Redirect user to Authorization URL.</li>
						<li>User accepts Facebook's prompt.</li>
						<li>
							User is redirected back to the redirect URL we gave Facebook 
							with a code in the query string.
						</li>
						<li>
							Server privately exchanges that code with Facebook for an
							access token.
						</li>
					</ol>

					<aside class="notes">
						Now, a quick lesson on OAuth2. This is how the server side authorization
						workflow works for OAuth2 (across the board).
						<br>
						The basic concept is we redirect the user to and from a number of places,
						ensuring the referrer and given destination are fully approved by the
						app creator. Once the user gets back to us, we are given a non-descript
						code, which we will combine with our app secret to send to Facebook, in
						exchange for a real access token.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Building the Authorization URL</h2>
					<p>
						This is incredibly trivial:
						<pre>
							<code data-trim contenteditable>
import urllib
auth_uri = "https://www.facebook.com/dialog/oauth?" + urllib.urlencode({
  "client_id": APP_ID,
  "redirect_uri": REDIRECT_URI,
  "scope": ','.join(("user_photos", "public_profile", "email", "publish_actions")) 
})
							</code> 
						</pre>
						<aside class="notes">
							We're going to cheat and use urllib here, but it's all quite simple.
							<br>
							Really, the most difficult thing here can be finding the scopes sometimes
							(Google loves to hide them), but the scopes listed here should let you publish
							videos and photos, fetch photos, and view profile information for a FB user.
						</aside>
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Authorize It</h2>
					<p>
						I love Python:
						<pre>
							<code data-trim contenteditable>
from webbrowser import open as wopen
wopen(auth_uri)
							</code> 
						</pre>

						<img src="img/exchange_code.png">

						<aside class="notes">
							So yea, this should open your browser, take you to FB and display
							the super familiar OAuth prompt dialog. 
							<br>
							Upon return, you'll notice there's a code query string parameter 
							in the URL we were redirected to, grab that. Ignore #_#_
						</aside>
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Exchange the Code for an Access Token</h2>
					<p>
						<pre>
							<code data-trim contenteditable>
url = "https://graph.facebook.com/oauth/access_token"
p = {
    "client_id": APP_ID,
    "redirect_uri": REDIRECT_URI,
    "client_secret": APP_SECRET,
    "code": code
}
resp = requests.get(url, params=p)
data = dict(urlparse.parse_qsl(resp.text))
access_token = data["access_token"]
							</code>
						</pre>
						<aside class="notes">
							Now thing's get a little more interesting, but still not too rough
							<br>
							We have to break out urlparse here to get a nice dictionary.
							Because FB gives us this:
							access_token=TOK&expires=EXP
							<br>
							This dictionary has the "access_token" and "expires" keys. Former is
							obvious, the latter is actually the number of seconds until the token
							expires, and not a timestamp.
						</aside>
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Fetching Your Profile Info</h2>
					<p>
						<pre>
							<code data-trim contenteditable>
params = {'access_token': access_token}
resp = requests.get("https://graph.facebook.com/v2.2/me", params=params)
data = resp.json()
							</code>
						</pre>
						<aside class="notes">
							We'll do the easy task of first just fetching your own profile info.
							FB makes this delightfully easy with a nice little me endpoint.
							They also now return in a sane data format! JSON!
						</aside>
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>The Result</h2>
					<pre>
							<code data-trim contenteditable>
{
    'timezone': -4,
    'locale': 'en_US',
    'first_name': 'Hayden',
    'id': '983166765027138',
    'name': 'Hayden Chudy',
    'gender': 'male',
    'last_name': 'Chudy',
    'link': 'https://www.facebook.com/app_scoped_user_id/983166765027138/',
    'email': 'hjc1710@gmail.com',
    'updated_time': '2015-02-03T21:22:01+0000',
    'verified': True
}
							</code>
						</pre>

						<aside class="notes">
							Nice and simple. However we just needed the access token and we could
							freely go from there. It would be quite nice to have some extra security.
						</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>The App Secret Proof</h2>
						<p>
							<ul>
								<li>An option in the developers console.</li>
								<li>Once enabled a new 'appsecret_proof' query param is needed for all server requests.</li>
							</ul>
							<aside class="notes">
								Enter the app secret proof. You have to enable in this in the developer console
								on FB's side, but you can make it so all server-side requests require an
								app secret. Once we enable this, if we repeat the previous request, we'll get a
								nice 403 and an OAuth error 100.

								This is one of the things that pythonforfacebook does not support.
							</aside>
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>The App Secret Proof</h2>
						<pre>
							<code data-trim contenteditable>
import hashlib
import hmac
appsecret_proof = hmac.new(
    APP_SECRET, 
    access_token, 
    hashlib.sha256
).hexdigest()
							</code>
						</pre>
						
						<p>
							<aside class="notes">
								The app secret proof is made by hashing your access token, using your
								App secret, as the key. Now we will append that to all of our future GET requests.
								Differs for everyone, prevents against rainbow attacks or what have you.
							</aside>
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>A Repeat</h2>
						<pre>
							<code data-trim contenteditable>
params = {'access_token': access_token, 'appsecret_proof': appsecret_proof}
resp = requests.get("https://graph.facebook.com/v2.2/me", params=params)
data = resp.json()
							</code>
						</pre>

						<aside class="notes">
							Now that we've added our appsecret proof, everything goes according to plan.
						</aside>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>The Fields API</h2>
						<p>
							<pre>
								<code data-trim contenteditable>
url = "https://graph.facebook.com/v2.2/me?fields=albums.fetch(5){id}"
resp = requests.get(url, params=params)
								</code>
							</pre>
							<aside class="notes">
								Now, onto something more fun. We'll use the fields API to fetch and
								paginate some photos. FB has this cool functionality where we can just
								continue to hit the me endpoint and then specify what. Now, all we get
								in return are pagination links, and the ID's. We can now individually
								specify what fields we want all the time
							</aside>
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>One Step Further</h2>
						<pre>
								<code data-trim contenteditable>
url = "https://graph.facebook.com/v2.2/me?"
url += "fields=albums.fetch(5){id,photos.fetch(5){source, id}}"
resp = requests.get(url, params=params)
photo = resp.json()['albums']['data'][0]['photos']['data'][0]
								</code>
							</pre>
						<aside class="notes">
							The fields API supports addressing nested resources as well, here, we'll
							fetch our first 5 albums, and then the first 5 photos from those albums. But,
							we'll only fetch the link and id from the photos. And that's what is returned,
							it's all very predictable, all the wrappers and the storage structures are the
							same. 'data' and 'paging', then '$resource_name'.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<pre>
								<code data-trim contenteditable>
{
    'created_time': '2015-03-13T15:34:58+0000',
    'id': '976486925695122',
    'source': 'https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/10525958_976486925695122_844676533185672955_n.jpg?oh=ea15800e5c1038cce6962b69e66c03da&oe=55B1CBF3'
}
								</code>
							</pre>
							<aside class="notes">
								Tada! We now have the single photo we were looking for, and with the
								smallest number of fields. The fields API is rather powerful and lets
								you fetch the exact data pieces you want. It's perfect for serious querying.
							</aside>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Downloading Through Requests</h2>
						<pre>
							<code data-trim contenteditable>
link = photo['source']
							</code>
						</pre>

						<aside class="notes">
							So, in that last response, you'll notice we got a link back for the photo.
							Let's download that photo! It should be rather simple.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Downloading Through Requests</h2>
						<p>
							<pre>
								<code data-trim contenteditable>
file = requests.get(link, stream=True)
with open("./out.png", 'wb') as out:
    for chunk in file.iter_content(chunk_size=2048):
        if chunk:	
            out.write(chunk)
            out.flush()
								</code>
							</pre>
							<aside class='notes'>
								Turns it is rather simple! We just get the link, we don't even need auth params,
								and then we set stream to True. What stream=True does is it lets us download
								the file in chunks. So instead of reading the entire file into memory before
								writing it back to disk, Python will just read smaller chunks. Now, let's upload 
								a file. Again, all of this has been so damn simple. Would they really make this tough?
							</aside>
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Uploading Through Requests</h2>

						<pre>
							<code data-trim contenteditable>
form_data = {
    'message': "NYC Python Is Great",
    'privacy[value]': "SELF",
    'appsecret_proof': appsecret_proof,
    'access_token': access_token
}

f = open("./out.png", "rb")
source_file = {'source': ('out.png', f, 'image/png')}
url = "https://graph.facebook.com/v2.2/photos"
resp = requests.post(url, data=form_data, files=source_file, stream=True)
							</code>
						</pre>

						<aside class="notes">
							Turns out the answer is no there. The strangest thing in this entire code
							example is the value for the source key. Which is really just: filename, file
							data, mimetype. Which, if you know multipart forms, makes tons of sense.
						</aside>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>SDK Next Steps</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Roll all of that up into helper functions.</li>
						<li>Create a good, reusable request object.</li>
						<li>Cover every endpoint in the API reference.</li>
						<li>Release SDK.</li>
						<li>Maintain SDK.</li>
					</ul>
